This is a simple GTK tray icon to swap Bluetooth headset modes between the
`a2dp_sink` mode and `handsfree_head_unit` mode.

### Why?

The A2DP Bluetooth profile has much higher audio quality, but doesn't support
being used as a microphone, while the HSP/HFP profile allows a headset to act
as a microphone but reduces audio quality. By clicking on the tray icon and
then selecting a headset, you can swap between these at will when listening to
music or using your headset for videoconferencing.
